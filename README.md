# Cultural Web: Week 3 seminar exercise

Welcome to the *Gallery of Strange Things*

We're starting to work on our website but unfortunately our contractor left before they implemented a load of links, images, videos etc. Your help is needed!

The first thing to do is to clone this repository onto your personal computer, so that you can edit it.

## Instructions

1. Hit the green Code button above, then HTTPS. Copy the long URL which begins with https://github.com/ by pressing the clipboard icon on the right.
2. Open Visual Studio Code on your computer
3. Hit File > New Window.   
4. Click the Source Control icon on the left (third icon from top, three joined circles), then "Clone Repository". Paste in the copied url.
5. You will be asked to select a folder to clone this repository (ie download the code) into. Choose one that makes sense to you. (Advice: keep a KCL folder and in that a module folder, in that a cultural-web folder). Hit enter.
6. When VS Code has cloned everything, a menu should pop up in the bottom right asking if you want to open it. Hit Open!
7. Now you're in. Select index.html and edit away.
8. To see how this appears in a browser, make sure you've installed the Open in Browser extension by TechER. Then right click on your code and select Open in Other Browsers. After you make a change in the html, refreshing the page in the browser to update it.
